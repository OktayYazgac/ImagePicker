# ImagePicker
A demo tool that may be helpful to my project ADBot
It render a PNG file in full size and tell you what your script cares about.

## Usage
- Run it
- Drop a PNG file in the window or choose file by click Open button.
- Drag mouse to navigate in the image.
- Left click on any point, the read-only edit box will show the (X,Y) in percentage and it color in RGB hexadecimal value.
- Right click on a point to compare its color with previous click point, in the result of distance of points in the RGB color space.

## Todo
- Keep previous clicked points after drag canvas, yes, they get lost after re-paint now
- More customizable, if needed anyway

## Compiler
Delphi XE7 Win64
No 3rd-party libraies needed
